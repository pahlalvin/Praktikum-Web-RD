                <h2>Design and manufacture of Amrita Surya Vahini â€” A solar auto rickshaw</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Renewable energy is vital for today's world since in the near future the non-renewable sources that we are using are going to get exhausted. The solar vehicle is a step towards saving these non-renewable sources of energy. A solar vehicle uses energy generated directly from PV panels and solar energy stored in the on-board battery. The real-time solar power and the charged batteries are used to drive the electric motor and move the vehicle in reverse and forward directions. This innovative solar vehicle, known as Amrita Surya Vahini, is a three wheeled solar auto rickshaw designed and fabricated without a differential mechanism by using BLDC hub motors directly coupled to the wheels. The vehicle uses a 1200 Watt flexible solar panel which is placed not only on the roof top but also on the sides of the auto rickshaw. The vehicle runs at a top speed of 50 km/hr and travels a distance of 80 to 120 km per battery charge with a cruising speed of 30 km/hr. The manufactured solar auto rickshaw is a light weight and efficient, with a design that can be commercialised for the benefit of the society. 
                Additional research is needed to determine to confirm and elucidate the benefits of these ingredients in the prevention and management of skin disease.</p>

                <h2>Implementation of Solar Tracking System to Maximize Energy Absorption in Wireless Sensor Network</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Wireless Sensor Network is a system to monitor area condition from the different place. WSN is usually located in distant or difficult to reach places, therefore the use of energy is very important and become a big concern. One of the solutions is WSN must be able to generate energy from the renewable energy such as sunlight. There are so many researches which propose the new way of increasing energy produced by solar cells. This is effective but still have a room of improvement such as to ensure maximum absorption energy by solar panels, the direction of the coming light must be perpendicular to the surface solar panels, and this is not yet achieved. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of solar panels, the author took the initiativeto combine Maximum Power Point Tracking technology with dual axis solar tracking system to optimize absorption energy by solar panels. The proposed solar tracking technology uses LDR sensors to detect the direction of the coming light, so this system can adjust to various conditions to make sure the absorption is maximum. </p>

                <h2>Improving Solar Panel Efficiency by Solar Tracking and Tilt Angle Optimization with Deep Learning</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The surge in energy demand over the last few decades has led to the vast depletion of natural sources of energy and calls for active research and development of effective renewable energy systems. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable source of energy available to us and thus, adoption of solar energy over other energy sources can be an efficient way to secure a sustainable future. However, the change in the sun's relative position to earth through the day varies the intensity of sunlight falling on the photo-voltaic cells of a solar panel, leading to a substantial decrease in its overall efficiency. Therefore, development should concentrate on achieving greater efficiencies using solar panel arrays in order to generate maximum solar power. This paper proposes a solution by tracking the sun's relative position to earth continuously and optimizing the tilt angle of the solar panel accordingly with deep learning. The proposed method predicts the tilt and orientation angle of the sun with a 97% accuracy, resulting in the increase of the solar output power by 10.6% when compared to other non-tracking</p>
